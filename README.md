# NumberHunter 
This is my first project as a B.Tech newbie, and Iâ€™m excited to see how far I can go with C programming!.
A simple console game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and shows the total number of attempts once the correct number is guessed.
"NumberHunter" is a simple number-guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program gives feedback after each guess, telling the user whether to guess higher or lower. It tracks the number of attempts and displays the total once the correct number is guessed.
